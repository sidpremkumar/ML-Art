# Mozart

This is the code behind the project [Mozart](https://sidpremkumar.com/mozGan_v1.html). Check out my website to learn more about what I'm trying to do. 

## Getting Started
The code developed is not very easy to run standalone. You have to first convert the images then modify the code to run the AC-GAN.
Take a look at MozGan2.py to get started. It is pretty well documented.

You should be running the program on a GPU if you can, otherwise it will end up taking a very long time. Especially if you are using images larger than 28x28x1
